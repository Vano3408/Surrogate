# Surrogate
Surrogate is a Xposed module to replace any method, sending constant instead. If the main purpose of this software is to act as a complement for [RootCloak](https://github.com/devadvance/rootcloak), it could probably be used to mock services.

## Credits
* To [rovo89 and all the contributors](https://github.com/rovo89/) for their amazing work on Xposed framework
* To @Razer2015 for the inspiration and the reverse engineering done on some apps. Most of the rules existing in the default set are from him.
